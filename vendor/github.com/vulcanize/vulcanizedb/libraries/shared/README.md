# Shared Tools

## Description
Code that is useful for or used by plugins written on top of VulcanizeDB.

## Note
Much code in this directory may not be used outside of the tests, but don't delete it - it could be used by a plugin.
Renaming and/or deleting functions in this namespace requires a version bump to avoid breaking plugins.
