Note: If any of the plugin transformer need additional
configuration variables include them in the .toml file as well

This information is used to write and build a go plugin with a transformer 
set composed from the transformer imports specified in the config file
This plugin is loaded and the set of transformer initializers is exported
from it and loaded into and executed over by the appropriate watcher. 

The type of watcher that the transformer works with is specified using the 
type variable for each transformer in the config. Currently there are watchers 
of event data from an eth node (eth_event) and storage data from an eth node 
(eth_storage), and a more generic interface for accepting contract_watcher pkg
based transformers which can perform both event watching and public method 
polling (eth_contract).

Transformers of different types can be ran together in the same command using a 
single config file or in separate command instances using different config files

Specify config location when executing the command:
./vulcanizedb compose --config=./environments/config_name.toml`,
