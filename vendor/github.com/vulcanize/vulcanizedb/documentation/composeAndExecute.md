# composeAndExecute
The `composeAndExecute` command is used to compose and execute over an arbitrary set of custom transformers.
This is accomplished by generating a Go pluggin which allows the `vulcanizedb` binary to link to external transformers, so
long as they abide by one of the standard [interfaces](../staging/libraries/shared/transformer).

This command requires Go 1.11+ and [Go plugins](https://golang.org/pkg/plugin/) only work on Unix-based systems.

## Writing custom transformers
Storage Transformers
   * [Guide](../../staging/libraries/shared/factories/storage/README.md)
   * [Example](../../staging/libraries/shared/factories/storage/EXAMPLE.md)
    
Event Transformers   
   * [Guide](../../staging/libraries/shared/factories/event/README.md)
   * [Example 1](https://github.com/vulcanize/ens_transformers/tree/master/transformers/registar)
   * [Example 2](https://github.com/vulcanize/ens_transformers/tree/master/transformers/registry)
   * [Example 3](https://github.com/vulcanize/ens_transformers/tree/master/transformers/resolver)

Contract Transformers
   * [Example 1](https://github.com/vulcanize/account_transformers)
   * [Example 2](https://github.com/vulcanize/ens_transformers/tree/master/transformers/domain_records)

## Preparing transformers to work as a plugin for composeAndExecute
To plug in an external transformer we need to:

1. Create a package that exports a variable `TransformerInitializer`, `StorageTransformerInitializer`, or `ContractTransformerInitializer` that are of type [TransformerInitializer](../staging/libraries/shared/transformer/event_transformer.go#L33)
or [StorageTransformerInitializer](../../staging/libraries/shared/transformer/storage_transformer.go#L31),
or [ContractTransformerInitializer](../../staging/libraries/shared/transformer/contract_transformer.go#L31), respectively
2. Design the transformers to work in the context of their [event](../staging/libraries/shared/watcher/event_watcher.go#L83),
[storage](../../staging/libraries/shared/watcher/storage_watcher.go#L53),
or [contract](../../staging/libraries/shared/watcher/contract_watcher.go#L68) watcher execution modes
3. Create db migrations to run against vulcanizeDB so that we can store the transformer output
    * Do not `goose fix` the transformer migrations, this is to ensure they are always ran after the core vulcanizedb migrations which are kept in their fixed form
    * Specify migration locations for each transformer in the config with the `exporter.transformer.migrations` fields
    * If the base vDB migrations occupy this path as well, they need to be in their `goose fix`ed form
    as they are [here](../../staging/db/migrations)

To update a plugin repository with changes to the core vulcanizedb repository, replace the vulcanizedb vendored in the plugin repo (`plugin_repo/vendor/github.com/vulcanize/vulcanizedb`)
with the newly updated version
* The entire vendor lib within the vendored vulcanizedb needs to be deleted (`plugin_repo/vendor/github.com/vulcanize/vulcanizedb/vendor`)
* These complications arise due to this [conflict](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20481) between `dep` and Go plugins

## Configuration
A .toml config file is specified when executing the command:
`./vulcanizedb composeAndExecute --config=./environments/config_name.toml`

The config provides information for composing a set of transformers:

```toml
[database]
    name     = "vulcanize_public"
    hostname = "localhost"
    user     = "vulcanize"
    password = "vulcanize"
    port     = 5432

[client]
    ipcPath  = "/Users/user/Library/Ethereum/geth.ipc"

[exporter]
    home     = "github.com/vulcanize/vulcanizedb"
    name     = "exampleTransformerExporter"
    save     = false
    transformerNames = [
        "transformer1",
        "transformer2",
        "transformer3",
        "transformer4",
    ]
    [exporter.transformer1]
        path = "path/to/transformer1"
        type = "eth_event"
        repository = "github.com/account/repo"
        migrations = "db/migrations"
        rank = "0"
    [exporter.transformer2]
        path = "path/to/transformer2"
        type = "eth_contract"
        repository = "github.com/account/repo"
        migrations = "db/migrations"
        rank = "0"
    [exporter.transformer3]
        path = "path/to/transformer3"
        type = "eth_event"
        repository = "github.com/account/repo"
        migrations = "db/migrations"
        rank = "0"
    [exporter.transformer4]
        path = "path/to/transformer4"
        type = "eth_storage"
        repository = "github.com/account2/repo2"
        migrations = "to/db/migrations"
        rank = "1"
```
- `home` is the name of the package you are building the plugin for, in most cases this is github.com/vulcanize/vulcanizedb
- `name` is the name used for the plugin files (.so and .go)   
- `save` indicates whether or not the user wants to save the .go file instead of removing it after .so compilation. Sometimes useful for debugging/trouble-shooting purposes.
- `transformerNames` is the list of the names of the transformers we are composing together, so we know how to access their submaps in the exporter map
- `exporter.<transformerName>`s are the sub-mappings containing config info for the transformers
    - `repository` is the path for the repository which contains the transformer and its `TransformerInitializer`
    - `path` is the relative path from `repository` to the transformer's `TransformerInitializer` directory (initializer package).
        - Transformer repositories need to be cloned into the user's $GOPATH (`go get`)
    - `type` is the type of the transformer; indicating which type of watcher it works with (for now, there are only two options: `eth_event` and `eth_storage`)
        - `eth_storage` indicates the transformer works with the [storage watcher](../../staging/libraries/shared/watcher/storage_watcher.go)
         that fetches state and storage diffs from an ETH node (instead of, for example, from IPFS)
        - `eth_event` indicates the transformer works with the [event watcher](../../staging/libraries/shared/watcher/event_watcher.go)
         that fetches event logs from an ETH node
        - `eth_contract` indicates the transformer works with the [contract watcher](../staging/libraries/shared/watcher/contract_watcher.go)
        that is made to work with [contract_watcher pkg](../../staging/pkg/contract_watcher)
        based transformers which work with either a light or full sync vDB to watch events and poll public methods ([example1](https://github.com/vulcanize/account_transformers/tree/master/transformers/account/light), [example2](https://github.com/vulcanize/ens_transformers/tree/working/transformers/domain_records))
    - `migrations` is the relative path from `repository` to the db migrations directory for the transformer
    - `rank` determines the order that migrations are ran, with lower ranked migrations running first
        - this is to help isolate any potential conflicts between transformer migrations
        - start at "0" 
        - use strings
        - don't leave gaps
        - transformers with identical migrations/migration paths should share the same rank
- Note: If any of the imported transformers need additional config variables those need to be included as well   

This information is used to write and build a Go plugin which exports the configured transformers.
These transformers are loaded onto their specified watchers and executed.

Transformers of different types can be run together in the same command using a single config file or in separate instances using different config files   

The general structure of a plugin .go file, and what we would see built with the above config is shown below

```go
package main

import (
	interface1 "github.com/vulcanize/vulcanizedb/libraries/shared/transformer"
	transformer1 "github.com/account/repo/path/to/transformer1"
	transformer2 "github.com/account/repo/path/to/transformer2"
	transformer3 "github.com/account/repo/path/to/transformer3"
	transformer4 "github.com/account2/repo2/path/to/transformer4"
)

type exporter string

var Exporter exporter

func (e exporter) Export() []interface1.EventTransformerInitializer, []interface1.StorageTransformerInitializer, []interface1.ContractTransformerInitializer {
	return []interface1.TransformerInitializer{
            transformer1.TransformerInitializer,
            transformer3.TransformerInitializer,
        },     []interface1.StorageTransformerInitializer{
            transformer4.StorageTransformerInitializer,
        },     []interface1.ContractTransformerInitializer{
            transformer2.TransformerInitializer,
        }
}
```
